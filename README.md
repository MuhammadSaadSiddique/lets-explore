# Issue

Fighting tourist crowds and overtourism have become quite prevalent resulting in less authentic vacations. Some places in the world are unexplored and some are crowded. Most people travel to same places again and again. And in most of the cases, the reason is they don't know about new places and sometimes there are journey issues, ease of Payment etc.

# Mission

We intend to build an application to provide full traveling plans and show new places with their facilities including hotel booking, traveling solutions, accessibilities and activities. Payment wallet can be added. Offline mode can be added.
